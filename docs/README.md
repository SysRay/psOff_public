# Docs README

## Wiki update rules

### General rules
1. You should not put anything to root wiki directory (`docs/wiki/`);
2. All the `.md` files should go to `docs/wiki/markdown/` folder;
3. Your links should not lead to shady sites;
4. If you removed screenshot from the markdown code then delete the image itself in the `docs/wiki/markdown/images/` folder.

### Name your wiki files properly!
1. Do not use the following characters in your wiki page's titles: `\ / : * ? " < > |`;
2. Use `-` sign instead of space;
3. Too long name is not good at all, keep it ~32 chars long maximum;
4. It's cool that GitHub's markup engine supports so much markup languages, but keep it `md` for consistency, please. Markdowns are the easiest to maintain and most common pretty everywhere;
5. You should write wiki pages **only** in English. We also do not accept translated pages there since GitHub does not support them. The wiki would be a mess if we did accept these changes.

### Add screenshots if needed!
1. Don't do it too often;
2. Add screenshots that will actually help;
3. Draw eye directing arrows or circles of some kind on them, if possible and necessary;
4. Screenshots should be uploaded to this repository only, there are special folder for these: `docs/wiki/images/`, just use relative \(`/docs/wiki/images/image.png`\) links to add them in your markdown page;
5. Give your screenshots meaningful file names and put them in sub-directories so they don't get lost.
