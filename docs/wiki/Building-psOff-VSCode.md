# Building psOff modules using VSCode

> [!WARNING]
> This guide assuming that you have all the Vulkan/MSVC/Clang stuff installed. If you don't have it follow [the first two steps here](https://github.com/igor725/psOff_public/wiki/Building-psOff-from-scratch) and then return to this guide.

## Preparing the environment

When you open psOff repository with VSCode for the first time, it will show you the notification about installing recommended extensions. You should click `Show Recommenadtions` there.

If you missed this notification, then press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Focus on Workspace Recommendations View` and perss this button.

Now you'll see the sidebar with all the recommended extensions, you should install all of them. Or just press the `Install Workspace Recommended Extensions` button above, the one with the cloud icon.

It is recommended to restart the VSCode after you finish installing all the recommended extensions.
