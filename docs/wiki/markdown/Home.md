# Welcome to the psOff wiki!

psOff is a PlayStation 4 emulator (compatibility layer). We aim for best performance and visuals.

The emulator can't run heavy AAA games yet, but we working on getting them booting too. Here you can see our [list of compatible games](https://github.com/SysRay/psOff_compatibility/issues).
